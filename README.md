Redis Fail
==========

Many systems administrators(and developers) leave their Redis servers running into the wild,
in other words, they leave the `6379` port open to the whole internet. This small piece of software
was made just for fun and educational purposes. Use it as you wish, but please be so kind as to try
to find out the owner of the Redis server and inform them about the flaw.
